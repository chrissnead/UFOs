# UFOs

Use the UFO Finder [here](https://chrissnead.github.io/UFOs/){:target="_blank"}.

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to filter where and when UFO sightings have been documented.

## Results
This website allows users to search UFO sighting data by filtering specific criteria. There are five different filters to search the data table. You may filter by any combination of date, city, state, country, and shape. To update the filter, simply press 'Enter' on your keyboard or click anywhere outside the filters. To reset the filters, delete any text in the input boxes or refresh the page.

## Summary
One drawback of the website's design is the error handling of the filters. If I were to develop this website further, I'd make the input boxes dropdowns instead. Not all dates, cities, etc. are included in the data, but there is no way of knowing without typing it in and finding the filter returns a blank table. With a dropdown for each filter, this would eliminate any error and always return what the user expects. I would also allow filtering of more than one item for each column. Rather than filtering only for "ca", the user may want to see all UFO sightings for "ca" and "ar".
